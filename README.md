# RFP Accelerator - Transform Your Organization's Proposal Process
Responding to an Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Information (RFI) is a common task in a corporate setting. For most organizations, today this is a very cumbersome and time-consuming process involving multiple teams coordinating for weeks or even months at a time. 

Generative AI has the ability to transform the proposal response process from start to finish.

## RFP Accelerator
The goal of this Accelerator is to provide an API that allows various operations to be performed against RFPs.  The API leverages Python FastAPI for the backend and a Blazor Server App for the UI.  The API has a Swagger UI which can be accessed when running locally by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000.  The APIs can be testing directly from the Swagger Page so no need from PostMan or actually using the UI.

## Some operations do require you you call some of the various APIs in a specific order, which we will document here

# This is a work in progress

**Important Note** I am not using DevContainers because I have an issue with Docker that will requirement to reformat my laptop, and I simply have not had time to do that at the moment.
